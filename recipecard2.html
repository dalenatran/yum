        <ol>
          <li>In the medium saucepan, bring about 4 quarts of salted water to boil, drop in the shelled favas, and blanch about 2 minutes, until they turn bright green. Drain the beans, and drop them right away into a large bowl of ice water. When chilled, drain the favas again;peel off the inner skins and discard. You should have about 2 cups peeled favas.</li>
          <li>Pour 1/4 cup of the olive oil into the skillet, and set it over medium heat. Scatter the favas and sliced onion in the pan, stir, and cook until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes. Drop the cherry tomatoes into the skillet, and season with the salt. Cook until the cherry tomatoes release their juices and begin to break down, about 5 minutes; keep the sauce warm, until the pasta is dressed.
</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, fill the pasta pot with salted water, and heat to a rolling boil. Drop in the orecchiette, stir, and return to the boil. Cook the pasta until it’s approximately 5 minutes from being done, then stir the arugula into the pot. </li>
          <li>Cook the pasta and arugula together for another 4 minutes or so, until the orecchiette is al dente, then lift both from the pot with a large strainer, and drop the pasta and arugula into the skillet of sauce. Toss everything together for a minute or two, over low heat, then turn off the heat, drizzle on the remaining 2 tablespoon olive oil, and toss well. Sprinkle the grated cheese on top, and toss again. Heap the pasta in warm bowls, and serve immediately, with more cheese at the table.</li>
